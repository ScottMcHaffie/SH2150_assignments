This dataset consists of anonymized non-contrast head CT scans labeled into three clinically relevant categories: normal, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. The images were collected from the Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Health’s national e-Pulse and Teleradiology systems during 2019–2020, and annotated by seven board-certified radiologists. The dataset was curated for the TEKNOFEST-2021 Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare competition and is intended for research into automated medical image interpretation.
